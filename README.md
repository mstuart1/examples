Examples of my work

## Profact
My first project while working for the Office of Research Analytics was to build the database and backend api for a new version of [Profact](https://profact.rutgers.edu/), a website that helps professionals earn and maintain their fertilization application certification for the State of New Jersey.  I used [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) for the ORM and [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) for testing. I taught myself javascript during this project.  Users create accounts, enroll their staff members, and take exams.  Administrators are able to manage credits for coursework and there is a payment portal to accept online payments. There is an automated email component and the ability for administrators to filter the user list to send mass emails to select groups. There is a reporting tool that allows administrators to print reports. 

## School of Graduate Studies Independent Development Plan
My next project was to refine my backend skills using Sequelize to build the database and api for the School of Graduate Studies Independent Development Plan, which is not available for public viewing.
